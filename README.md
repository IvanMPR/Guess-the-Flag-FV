# Guess the Flag (Final Version)
 Hello! This is a fun quiz app where you can learn almost every flag that is used in the world !
 
As a player, you have two select option menus. 
With first, you can choose between English, Spanish and Serbian languages 
(Serbian also has the choice between Cyrillic and Latin alphabet!)
With the second option menu you can choose how the flags will be displayed: By each continent separately, or mixed up all together.
Also, there is a bonus level with almost 100 flags of the territories, dependencies, disputed regions, unrecognized countries, principalities...
and I bet that you've probably never heard for the most of them !

Regarding gameplay, after hitting the start button
random flag will be automaticaly displayed, along with total of 4 possible answers.
Depending on the players choice, true guess or wrong guess logic will be applied and rendered, 
and next flag will be displayed, untill the level is finished.

# Fun fact
I'm the creator of all of the flags used in the game !

# Tech side
HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
OOP with ES6 Classes and Prototype Inheritance, ES6 Modules, DOM Manipulation, Bind method, LocalStorage, Higher Order Array methods,
Template literals, are just some of the language features used to create this app.
# Future goals
To make the game responsive with media querries. This quizz format with flag field and answer fields/buttons stacked below that field, seems as a perfect 
candidate to render nicely on the smaller (phone size) screens.
Second goal is, for the sake of practice to transpile and polyfill this app using Parcel
and upload it to Netlify or some similar service.
